# Timer Game ⏳🎮

## Description
**Timer Game** is a simple and fun challenge where players test their sense of time! The goal is to press a button to start a timer and stop it as close as possible to a target time (e.g., **5 seconds**). The game then calculates how accurate the player was and displays the result.

## Features
- 🎯 **Multiple difficulty levels** (e.g., 1s, 5s, 10s, 15s)
- ⏳ **Real-time timer** with visual feedback
- 📊 **Accuracy scoring** based on how close the player's guess is to the target time
- ❌ **Win/Lose conditions** displayed in a pop-up modal

## How to Play
1. Click the **Start Challenge** button to begin.
2. Try to estimate the target time in your head.
3. Click **Stop** when you think the target time has passed.
4. The game checks your accuracy and shows whether you **win or lose**.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js** (Frontend)
- **CSS** (Styling)
- **JavaScript** (Game logic)

## Future Improvements
- 🏆 **Leaderboard** to track best scores
- 🎨 **Better animations & UI**
- 🔄 **Restart button** for quick replays
